This is a platform that helps to manage the COVID 19 problem.

Steps to get started

* `clone` your own fork not the main
* Do git checkout `name of your branch` for example `git checkout Group1/Authentication`
* To push to your own branch, 
`git add .`

`gitcommit -m "What you did"`

`git push origin Group1/Authentication`
